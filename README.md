## Construction
The project is assembled in a square metallic electrical box, 4 in. x 2⅛ in. deep (30.3 cu. in.), with ½ in. knockouts. The box acts as a heat sink for the solid state relay; use heat sink grease when fastening the SSR to the box.

See the links above for firmware and for a small PCB to facilitate mounting the LEDs and pushbutton switch.
